I have used pandas library to perform cleaning, detecting null values and finding duplicates in dataset.
Isnull() and duplicated() function is used to find out any null/ duplicate values in dataset.
I have check all columns for standardization of data.
Converted Date column to particular format dd-mm-yy.
Converted column names to lower case and checked if spaces available between column names.
Checked Datatypes and converted accordingly
